# Frequency Analysis of English and Russian Texts

## This is a small project where I analyzed two short texts — one in English and one in Russian — and looked at the most frequent words in each. I used Python and a few libraries we learned to work with, like NLTK, spaCy, pymorphy2, matplotlib, and wordcloud.

## Why I Did This Project
I wanted to better understand how to work with texts in Python and practice simple frequency analysis. It was also interesting to compare English and Russian — how often certain words appear, and what kinds of words are common.

## Basic steps: 
- Downloaded texts from Project Gutenberg — I picked a short English poem and a Russian poem.

- Cleaned the texts: I removed punctuation, made everything lowercase, and split the text into words.

- For English, I used NLTK for tokenization.

- For Russian, I used spaCy and pymorphy2 for lemmatization (to get the base form of each word).

- Then I used Counter from Python’s collections to count how often each word appeared.

- After that, I selected the top 10 most frequent words.

- I created bar charts to visualize these words.

- And finally, I generated word clouds — just for fun and to make the results more visual 😊

- I also saved the word cloud images as .png files.

## Tools and Libraries used:
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- NLTK
- spaCy
- pymorphy2
- matplotlib
- wordcloud
